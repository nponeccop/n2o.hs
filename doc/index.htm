<h2>N2O WebSocket Protocol</h2>

<h3>Protocols, Messages and Formatters</h3>

<p>If you put regular JSON on the wire sooner or later you will discover
your own wire protocol. Here is description of our N2O binary precise protocol.
N2O also has ASN.1 formal description, however here we will speak on it freely.</p>

<p>The only thing I want to add is that N2O protocol was created
naturally with niminal efforts, all modifications were
applied targetly and atomically. The current version of the protocol 2.3
is totally compatible with earlier versions up to 1.5
the <b>synrc/games</b> version, which was very progressive at the time.
Versions prior to 1.5 had very basic and naive but stable and fast
implementation of the core. All N2O releases are known to be stable
and supported half-year back. The evolution of the protocol is open
for a deeper discussion with interested party or protocol users.</p>

<p>You may find N2O protocol similar to extensible XML-based XMPP,
BINARY-based COM/CORBA and/or JSON-based WAMP; but most closer it
is to BERT-RPC binary-based protocol introduced by the GitHub.
N2O protocol is formatter agnostic and it doesn't strict you
to use a particular encoder/decoder.
N2O protocol has its own reference implementation in Erlang
which is widely used in production applications.
And experimental implementation in Haskell which is also using BERT formatter.
N2O provides definition support for several unoverlapped sub-protocols.
There is no single system shipped to support all of them but it could
exist theoretically.</p>

<!--ul><b><li>heart</li>
    <li>spa</li>
    <li>bin</li>
    <li>nitrogen</li>
    <li>bpe</li>
    <li>roster</li>
    <li>muc</li>
    <li>rest</li></b></ul-->

<p><center>Picture 1. Protocol Modules<br><br><img src="img/protocols.svg" width=500></center><br></p>

<p>N2O should not define any particular set of formatters.
Application developers could choose their own formatter per protocol.
E.g. N2O uses TEXT formatting for <<"PING">> and <<"N2O,">> protocol
messages, across versions N2O used to have IO message formatted with JSON and BERT both.
All other protocol messages were BERT from origin. The only thing is that protocol
formatter should be specified somehow.</p>

<ul><li>TEXT</li>
    <li>JSON</li>
    <li>XML</li>
    <li>BERT</li>
    <li>MessagePack</li></ul>

<p>All this formattes format message which comes directly to TCP WebSocket.
However there are some endpoints which are not TCP sockets, even non-sockets,
like gen_server endpoint, HTTP REST endpoint, which is non-WebSocket endpoint,
and there is a room for other endpoint types. Here is a list of types of
endpoints which arise in multi-protocol discussions:
</p>

<ul><li>gen_server</li>
    <li>ws</li>
    <li>http</li></ul>

<h3>Core</h3>

<p>The core protocols shipped with N2O provide very basic but yet
powerful functionality such as reconnects, page initialization
and common client/server messaging. The core is enough for
binary upload/download, games construction and SPA applications.</p>

<h4>heart</h4>

<p>The heart protocol defined client originated messages N2O, PING and
server originated messages IO and NOP. IO message contains EVAL that
contains UTF-8 JavaScript string and DATA reply contains any binary string.
"PING" and "N2O," are defined as text 4-bytes messages and second could be
followed by any text string. NOP is 0-byte acknowledging packet. This is
heart essence protocol which is enough for any rpc and code
transfering interface. Normally heart protocol is not for active
client usage but for supporting active connection with notifications
and possibly DOM updates.</p>

<div class=note style="width:600px;"><pre>1. IO tuple {io,EVAL,DATA}
2. NOP <<>>
3. N2O init marker <<"N2O,",AttachSession/binary>>
4. PING message <<"PING">>
</pre></div>

<br>
<p>Heartbeat protocol is essential WebSocket application
level protocol for PING and N2O initialization. It pings
every 4-5 seconds from client-side to server thus allowing
to determine client online presence. On reconnection or
initial connect client sends N2O init marker telling to
server to reinitialize the context.</p>

<div class=note style="width:220px;"><pre>ws.send('PING');
ws.send('N2O,');
</pre></div>

<br>
<p>IO events are containers for data and codata.
Third element of a tuple will be directly evaluated in WebBrowser.
IO events are normally not constructed on client.</p>

<blockquote>Haskell:</blockquote>
<div class=note><pre>
TupleTerm [AtomTerm "io", BinaryTerm data, BinaryTerm eval]
</pre></div>

<blockquote>Erlang:</blockquote>
<div class=note style="width:150px;"><pre>
{io,_,_}
</pre></div>

<h4>spa</h4>

<p>The spa protocol defined client originated messages CLIENT, SERVER and
server originated messages SERVER, IO and NOP. This protocol should be used
for normal data transfer as enveloping protocol. Client and server DATA
message should be specified for both server and client.</p>

<div class=note style="width:400px;"><pre>5. CLIENT tuple {client,DATA}
6. SERVER tuple {server,DATA}
</pre></div>

<br>
<p>Client messages usually originated at client and
represent the Client API Requests:</p>

<blockquote>JavaScript:</blockquote>
<div class=note style="width:550px;"><pre>
ws.send(enc(tuple(
      atom('client'),
      tuple(atom('join_game'),1000001))));
</pre></div>


<blockquote>Haskell:</blockquote>
<div class=note style="width:550px;"><pre>
TupleTerm [AtomTerm "client", Term body]</pre></div>

<blockquote>Erlang:</blockquote>
<p><div class=note style="width:150px;"><pre>
{client,_}</pre></div></p>

<h4>bin</h4>

<p>The bin protocol defined client originated messages BIN and
server originated messages BINARY and NOP. This protocol part is
dedicated to huge file transfers in binary form.</p>

<div class=note><pre>7. BIN tuple {bin,DATA}
8. BINARY tuple {binary,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_}
</pre></div>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>N2O protocol is not something statically defined. It contains
unintersected protocol sections, each defines its own complete
part of functionality. You may extend the protocol sections by
implementing you own protocol with its own envelop formatter.</p>

<h4>nitrogen</h4>

<p>The nitrogen protocol defined client originated messages PICKLE/EV and
server originated messages IO and NOP. This is something taken with
historicaly reasons and roots in Rusty's Nitrogen Web Framework. This
framework is transfering RPC events to page controllers though pickle
envelop, which could also provide ciphering. N2O supports AES/CBC cypher.
</p>

<div class=note><pre>9. PICKLE tuple {pickle,_,_,_}
10. EV tuple {ev,_,_,_,_}
</pre></div>

<br><p>You may think of nitrogen as a RPC secured protocol. If is very
handy in enterprise to use FORMS with N2O application server,
in those cases we use nitrogen as RPC protocol with nitogen-compatible pages.</p>

<blockquote>JavaScript:</blockquote>
<div class=note><pre>
JS> enc(tuple(atom('pickle'),
              atom('deposits'),
              tuple(atom('ev'),
                    atom('deposits'),
                    tuple(atom('error'),'6189'),
                    atom('#next'),
                    atom('event')),
              [tuple(atom('user'),'maxim'),
               tuple(atom('pass'),'token')]);
</pre></div>

<blockquote>Erlang:</blockquote>
<div class=note><pre>
{pickle,_,_,_}

      ERL> {pickle,deposits,
                   {ev,deposits,
                       {error,"6189"},
                       '#next',
                       event},
                   [{user,<<"maxim">>},
                    {pass,<<"token">>}].
</pre></div>

<br>
<p>PICKLE events are being sent pickled by server side picklers.
N2O supports following picklers:

<ul><li>PLAIN binary BERT encoding of the event or</li>
<li>AES/CBC encrypted event for sensitive information about the API.</li></ul></p>

<p>EV message contains RPC specification: target module,
originated module, event arguments and name of controller
function, for nitrogen the default type is <b>event</b>.</p>

<blockquote>Haskell:</blockquote>
<div class=note><pre>
TupleTerm [AtomTerm "ev", AtomTerm to, Term body,
                          AtomTerm from, AtomTerm type]
</pre></div>

<blockquote>Erlang:</blockquote>
<div class=note><pre>
{ev,_,_,_,_}
</pre></div>

<h4>mq</h4>

<p>The mq protocol defined client originated messages SUB, UNSUB, PUB, SUSPEND, RESUME
and server originated messages MSG.</p>

<div class=note><pre>11. SUB tuple {sub,NAME,OPTIONS}
12. UNSUB tuple {unsub,NAME}
13. PUB tuple {pub,NAME,DATA}
14. SUSPEND tuple {suspend,NAME}
15. RESUME tuple {suspend,NAME}
16. MSG tuple {msg,FROM,TO,DATA}
</pre></div>

<h4>bpe</h4>

<p>The bpe protocol defined client originated messages
GET, COMPLETE, RUN, UNTIL, AMEND, EVENT and ANY server originated
messages.</p>

<p><div class=note><pre>17. GET {get}
18. RUN {run}
19. UNTIL {until,Task}
20. EVENT {event,Event}
21. AMEND 2-tuple {amend,Form}
          3-tuple {amend,Form,true}
22. COMPLETE 1-tuple {complete}
             2-tuple {complete,Stage}
23. PROCESS 15-tuple
24. START
</pre></div>

<h4>roster</h4>

<p>The roster protocol defined client originated messages AUTH, ADD, CONFIRM,
CREATE, JOIN, MESSAGE, TYPING,  and server originated messages PERSON,
PRESENCE.</p>

<p><div class=note><pre>25. AUTH {auth,USER,TOKEN,SERVICES}
26. PERSON {person,ID,NAMES,SURNAMES,STATUS}
27. PRESENCE {presence,SIZE,USERS}
28. FRIEND {friend,USER,STATUS}
29. CONFIRM {confirm,USER,TYPE}
30. PRIVATE {message,ID,AUTHOR,BODY,STATUS}
31. TYPING {typing,AUTHOR}
</pre></div></p>

<h4>muc</h4>

<p>The multi-user chat protocol defined client originated messages JOIN, PUBLIC
and server originated messages ROOM, PUBLIC.</p>

<p><div class=note><pre>
32. ROOM {room,ID,NAME}
33. PUBLIC {public,ID,AUTHOR,ROOM,BODY,STATUS}
34. JOIN {join,USER,ROOM,ANSWER}
</pre></div></p>

<h4>rest</h4>

<p>The rest protocol defined client originated HTTP messages PUT, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
and server originated ANY messages formatted with JSON. This protocol is
slightly differs and is not WebSocket protocol but HTTP endpoint protocol
provided by <b>rest</b> library and <b>kvs</b> abstract database.</p>

<p><div class=note><pre>
33. GET {get,Resource}
        {get,Resource,Id}
